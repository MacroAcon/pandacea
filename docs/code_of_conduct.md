# Pandacea Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Pandacea is dedicated to building consent-driven data ecosystems that empower people. This commitment extends to our community conduct. We strive to create an environment that is inclusive, respectful, and aligned with the core values that drive our technical work: consent, transparency, reciprocity, and agency.

As participants in this community, we pledge to make participation a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Core Principles

Our community interactions are guided by the same principles that inform our technical architecture:

1. **Consent-Driven Engagement**: We respect boundaries and obtain meaningful consent before engaging others in discussions, projects, or initiatives.

2. **Transparent Communication**: We communicate clearly, honestly, and openly, ensuring others understand our intentions and expectations.

3. **Local Sovereignty**: We respect each person's autonomy and right to define their own experience, just as we respect their data sovereignty.

4. **Reciprocity and Mutual Benefit**: We contribute to the community in ways that benefit others, not just ourselves.

5. **Verifiable Accountability**: We take responsibility for our actions and their impact on others.

## Expected Behavior

Participants in the Pandacea community are expected to:

- **Practice empathy and respect** toward other community members
- **Communicate openly and considerately**, valuing diverse perspectives
- **Focus on what is best for the community** and the project's mission
- **Show courtesy and respect** in all interactions, online and in-person
- **Actively seek consent** before engaging others in potentially sensitive discussions
- **Be mindful of power dynamics** and create space for marginalized voices
- **Accept constructive criticism gracefully** and provide feedback respectfully
- **Take responsibility** for mistakes and learn from them
- **Prioritize the safety and comfort** of community members, especially those from marginalized groups

## Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include, but are not limited to:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Publishing others' private information without explicit consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions, events, or other community activities
- Making assumptions about someone's identity, experience, or background
- Ignoring stated boundaries or consent expressions
- Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors
- Any behavior that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Relationship to Project Values

This Code of Conduct directly reflects the values embodied in Pandacea's technical architecture:

- Just as the Consent Manager and Consent Genome enforce boundaries in data sharing, we enforce boundaries in community interactions
- Like our transparent audit mechanisms, our community processes are open and reviewable
- Similar to our ethical compensation model, we value equitable and mutually beneficial exchanges
- As with our edge-native approach to data, we prioritize individual agency in community participation

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including GitHub repositories, Discord channels, community calls, in-person events, and any other forums created by the project team. It also applies when representing the project or its community in public spaces, such as using official project social media accounts, participating in online forums, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community moderators at [conduct@pandacea.org]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The moderation team is committed to:

- **Respecting privacy and confidentiality** of those reporting violations
- **Providing clear explanations** of enforcement decisions
- **Using graduated responses** appropriate to the severity of the violation
- **Documenting processes** to ensure transparency and consistency
- **Following up** with affected community members

Community moderators have the responsibility to clarify and enforce our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Initial Response**: Acknowledgment of received report within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Gathering information from all parties with respect for privacy
3. **Decision**: Determining appropriate response based on severity and context
4. **Communication**: Informing relevant parties of the decision and rationale
5. **Implementation**: Applying the decided consequence
6. **Follow-up**: Checking in with affected parties and monitoring ongoing behavior

## Consequences

Consequences for violations may include:

- **Correction**: Private or public request to modify behavior
- **Warning**: Clear notice that continued behavior will result in further consequences
- **Temporary Ban**: Restricted access to community spaces for a specified time period
- **Permanent Ban**: Indefinite exclusion from community participation
- **Revocation of Roles**: Removal from positions of responsibility within the community

## Amendments

This Code of Conduct may evolve over time based on community feedback and needs. Amendments will be proposed through the standard governance process with appropriate community input.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html], and modified to align with Pandacea's core values and architectural principles.
