# Pandacea Architecture

This document provides a detailed overview of Pandacea's architecture, which is designed to enable consent-driven, ethically-compensated, and agent-aware data ecosystems.

## Architectural Principles

Pandacea's architecture is guided by several core principles:

1. **Edge-Native Sovereignty**: Consent enforcement happens at the point of data generation
2. **Purposeful Exchange**: All data requests must include explicit purpose and context
3. **Revocable Consent**: Users maintain control to modify or revoke access
4. **Transparent Accountability**: All data exchanges are auditable
5. **Ethical Compensation**: Fair rewards for meaningful participation
6. **Federation by Design**: Avoiding single points of failure or control
7. **Agent-Awareness**: Supporting evolving human-agent and agent-agent interactions

## High-Level Overview

Pandacea distributes enforcement across a constellation of local and federated actors rather than centralizing collection and control. This ensures users remain the primary authority over their data while enabling secure, purpose-driven sharing.

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture:

## Core Components

### 1. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol is a flexible, standardized format for requesting and exchanging data. MCP ensures that every data request includes:

- **Clear Purpose**: Specific declared intent for data use encoded in Purpose DNA
- **Requestor Identity**: Who is requesting the data
- **Expected Compensation**: What the user will receive in return
- **Trust Tier**: Level of trust associated with the requestor
- **Required Permissions**: Specific data elements and access patterns

#### Key MCP Message Types:

- `DataRequest`: Initiates data access with purpose, scope, and compensation
- `ConsentResponse`: User's structured response (approval, denial, modification)
- `AccessRevocation`: Terminates previously granted access
- `PurposeUpdate`: Notifies of changes to data usage purpose
- `CompensationEvent`: Documents value exchange for data use

#### Sample MCP Request Structure:

```json
{
  "messageType": "DataRequest",
  "requestorId": "org:health-research-institute:diabetes-study",
  "requestTimestamp": "2025-04-05T14:32:10Z",
  "purposeDNA": {
    "category": "medical-research",
    "specificPurpose": "type-2-diabetes-correlation-study",
    "dataRetention": "18-months",
    "privacyModel": "differential-privacy-epsilon-3"
  },
  "dataRequest": {
    "fields": ["activity-metrics", "heart-rate", "sleep-data"],
    "timeframe": {"start": "rolling-30-days", "duration": "18-months"},
    "frequency": "daily",
    "processingLocation": "on-device"
  },
  "compensationOffer": {
    "type": "research-findings-access",
    "alternativeType": "financial",
    "value": "0.50-USD-per-month"
  },
  "trustTier": {
    "level": 3,
    "certifications": ["IRB-approved", "data-minimization-verified"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Consent Manager + Consent Genome

The Consent Manager and Consent Genome form the core of user sovereignty in Pandacea.

**Consent Manager**: A local agent running on the user's edge device that:
- Interprets incoming MCP requests
- Applies rules from the Consent Genome
- Manages approval workflows
- Enforces revocations and time limits
- Communicates with the Sentinel Agent for security validation

**Consent Genome**: A dynamic, on-device record that captures:
- User's evolving data sharing preferences
- History of approvals and denials
- Purpose-specific consent rules
- Time and context restrictions
- Trust tier requirements

The Consent Genome adapts based on user behavior, explicit preferences, and system feedback. It represents not just what data a user will share, but under what circumstances, for what purposes, and with whom.

#### Example Consent Genome Rule:

```json
{
  "ruleName": "Health Research Sharing",
  "dataTypes": ["activity-metrics", "heart-rate", "sleep-quality"],
  "purposeCategories": ["medical-research", "public-health"],
  "excludedPurposes": ["pharmaceutical-marketing"],
  "minimumTrustTier": 2,
  "temporalRestrictions": {
    "requiresRenewal": true,
    "maxDuration": "180-days"
  },
  "compensationPreferences": {
    "preferred": "research-findings-access",
    "minimumFinancial": "0.25-USD-per-month"
  },
  "processingRequirements": {
    "allowsCloudProcessing": false,
    "requiresAnonymization": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Sentinel Agent

The Sentinel Agent acts as an active guardrail for the Consent Manager, providing additional protection and security validation. It is co-located with the Consent Manager on the user's edge device.

Key functions include:

- **Threat Detection**: Monitoring for suspicious patterns in data requests
- **Anomaly Identification**: Flagging unusual behavior from previously approved requestors
- **Request Validation**: Verifying the integrity and authenticity of incoming requests
- **Enhanced Protection**: Providing fallback security if the Consent Manager is compromised
- **Audit Protection**: Ensuring the integrity of local audit logs

The Sentinel Agent implements multiple protection strategies:

- Pattern-based detection for known attack vectors
- Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
- Rate limiting for suspicious activity
- Trust boundary enforcement
- Contextual risk assessment

### 4. Cloud Coordination Layer

The Cloud Coordination Layer facilitates communication between participants without gaining access to raw data or consent decisions. It is intentionally minimal in scope and designed for eventual federation.

Functions include:

- **Message Routing**: Directing MCP messages between endpoints
- **Discovery**: Helping locate valid MCP endpoints
- **Protocol Validation**: Ensuring messages follow MCP specifications
- **Federation Support**: Enabling multiple coordination nodes to interoperate

The Coordination Layer is stateless by design, maintaining no permanent record of transactions beyond what's needed for operational integrity.

### 5. Audit & Integrity Layer

The Audit & Integrity Layer ensures transparency and accountability without compromising privacy. Each component includes:

**Local Audit Log**: A tamper-resistant record maintained on each user's device that documents:
- Approved and denied requests
- Purpose changes and notifications
- Compensation events
- Security alerts and anomalies

**Audit Twin**: A cryptographic twin of the Local Audit Log that enables verification without revealing the complete record.

**Selective Anchoring**: Optional publication of audit hashes to distributed ledgers or timestamping services for public verifiability.

**Verification Tools**: Mechanisms for users, regulators, or trusted third parties to verify claims without exposing raw data.
