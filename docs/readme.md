## An Open Framework for Consent-Driven Data Ecosystems

Pandacea is an open framework for building consent-driven, ethically-compensated, and agent-aware data ecosystems that places privacy, consent, and reciprocity at the foundation of how data flows.

For a comprehensive overview of Pandacea's vision, architecture, and technical specifications, please read our [Whitepaper](pandacea_whitepaper.md).

## Vision

Modern data systems are optimized for extraction, not consent. Platforms routinely harvest personal information under vague policies and buried agreements, prioritizing monetization over meaningful user control. Meanwhile, the rise of AI is dramatically increasing demand for high-volume, highly-specific data.

Without intervention, this trend will deepen, and people will lose agency as machines gain it.

Pandacea exists to confront this growing imbalance. It replaces opaque surveillance and one-sided APIs with transparent, purposeful exchange, enforced locally by user-controlled consent mechanisms. The architecture shifts from centralized collection to edge-native sovereignty, and from static permissions to adaptive, context-aware consent.

**Pandacea is not a product. It is not a platform. It is a foundationâ€”for anyone who believes the future of data should serve people, not exploit them.**

## Core Architecture

Pandacea's architecture consists of five key components designed to enforce consent and context at the point of data generation:

1. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: A flexible, open protocol for requesting and exchanging data with clear purpose, identity, compensation, trust tier, and required permissions.

2. **Consent Manager + Consent Genome**: A local agent running on the user's edge device that interprets incoming requests against the user's evolving Consent Genome.

3. **Sentinel Agent**: Co-located with the Consent Manager, acting as an active guardrail to monitor for suspicious activity and enforce advanced threat response logic.

4. **Cloud Coordination Layer**: A minimal, stateless service facilitating the discovery of MCP endpoints and routing requests between participants.

5. **Audit & Integrity Layer**: Each edge device maintains a tamper-aware local audit log to ensure verifiability across participants without exposing raw data.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for detailed technical specifications.

## Current Status

Pandacea is currently in the early development phase (Phase 0: Infrastructure Groundwork). We are establishing foundational elements, defining protocols, and building our community. See our [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for development phases and milestones.
