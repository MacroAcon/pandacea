# Pandacea Project Roadmap

## Vision
Pandacea is an open framework for building consent-driven, ethically-compensated, and agent-aware data ecosystems. Our mission is to create infrastructure that enables individuals to be compensated for the valuable data they generate, transforming "Data Provider" into a legitimate gig function in the age of automation and agentic AI.

## Guiding Principles
- **User Sovereignty:** Individuals control their data and how it's used
- **Edge-Native Privacy:** Consent enforced at the device level
- **Ethical Compensation:** Fair rewards for meaningful data contribution
- **Transparent Purpose:** Clear understanding of how and why data is used
- **Progressive Decentralization:** Community-driven governance and operation
