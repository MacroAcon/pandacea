    # Pandacea MCP Security Considerations

    This document outlines security considerations for implementing and using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). While the protocol includes cryptographic signatures, overall security depends on correct implementation and deployment practices.

    ## 1. Cryptography

    *   **Signature Algorithm Support**: The current reference implementation focuses on Ed25519. If extending to support other algorithms (e.g., ECDSA), ensure robust implementation and validation of algorithm identifiers and key/signature lengths.
    *   **Signature Verification**:
        *   **Requests**: Always verify the signature of incoming `MCPRequest` messages using the public key provided in the `requestor_identity`.
        *   **Responses**: Always verify the signature of incoming `MCPResponse` messages. This requires obtaining the *responder's* public key through a trusted channel (e.g., configuration, secure directory lookup based on `key_id`). **Never trust a public key included directly in the response itself.**
    *   **Canonicalization**: For signatures to be verifiable across different implementations or even different versions of the same implementation, a strict canonical serialization format MUST be defined and used before signing and verification. Standard Protobuf encoding is insufficient.
    *   **Key Management**:
        *   **Storage**: Private keys MUST be stored securely. Avoid hardcoding keys or storing them in insecure configuration. Use platform secure storage (HSM, Keychain, TPM), environment variables (with caution), or encrypted files with strong access controls.
        *   **Rotation**: Implement a key rotation strategy appropriate for your security requirements and trust model.
        *   **Revocation**: Consider how revoked keys will be handled (e.g., using Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) if using a PKI, or a custom revocation list mechanism). Verification should check revocation status.

    ## 2. Validation

    *   **Input Validation**: Rigorously validate ALL fields in received MCP messages (Syntax, Semantics, Security stages). Do not trust any data received from external sources. Pay close attention to:
        *   String lengths and content (prevent injection).
        *   Enum values (ensure they are defined).
        *   Timestamp validity and plausibility (prevent replay attacks, enforce expiry).
        *   Resource identifiers (ensure they map to valid, expected resources).
        *   Constraint structures (ensure they are well-formed and values are expected types/ranges).
    *   **Resource Limits**: Implement limits on message size, permission count, payload size, etc., to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks via resource exhaustion. These checks should occur early, potentially even before full deserialization or validation.

    ## 3. Transport Security

    MCP focuses on message-level authenticity and integrity via signatures. It does **not** specify transport-level security. Always transmit MCP messages over a secure channel (e.g., TLS, DTLS) to ensure confidentiality and prevent eavesdropping or tampering *in transit*.

    ## 4. Purpose and Consent

    *   **PurposeDNA Scrutiny**: The `PurposeDNA` should be carefully evaluated by the Responder/Consent Manager. Ensure the stated purpose is clear, legitimate, and aligns with user consent or established policies.
    *   **Constraint Evaluation**: The constraint evaluation logic is security-critical. Ensure the `RequestContext` is populated accurately and that constraint checks (time, frequency, location, etc.) are implemented correctly to enforce policy.

    ## 5. Identity and Trust

    *   **Pseudonymity**: The `pseudonym_id` provides a stable identifier but doesn't guarantee the requestor's real-world identity.
    *   **Attestations**: The `attestations` field is optional and requires a separate infrastructure for verification. If used, ensure the attestation sources are trusted and verification is performed correctly.
    *   **Responder Trust**: The Requestor needs a mechanism to trust the Responder (Consent Manager) and obtain its authentic public key for response verification.

    ## 6. Implementation Risks

    *   **Logic Bugs**: Errors in validation, signature handling, or constraint evaluation can lead to security vulnerabilities. Thorough testing (including fuzzing and property-based testing) is crucial.
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Keep dependencies (cryptographic libraries, Protobuf implementations) up-to-date and monitor them for known vulnerabilities.

    By addressing these considerations, implementations can build a more secure system around the Pandacea MCP protocol.
