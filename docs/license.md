# License: GNU Affero General Public License v3.0

Pandacea is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0).

## Why AGPL-3.0?

We've chosen the AGPL-3.0 license for Pandacea because it strongly aligns with our core values of transparency, reciprocity, and community governance. This license:

1. **Protects User Freedom**: Ensures that all users receive the freedom to use, study, share, and modify the software.

2. **Preserves Openness**: Requires that modifications remain open source, preventing appropriation of the code into closed systems that could undermine our consent-driven principles.

3. **Network Service Protection**: Uniquely extends copyleft provisions to software accessed over a network, ensuring that cloud or API implementations of Pandacea components maintain the same freedoms.

4. **Community Alignment**: Supports our vision of progressive decentralization and community stewardship by ensuring all participants have equal access to the codebase.

5. **Mission Safeguarding**: Protects the project from being incorporated into systems that could contradict our core mission of consent-driven, ethically-compensated data ecosystems.

## License Summary

The AGPL-3.0 provides the following key freedoms:

- **Freedom to use** the software for any purpose
- **Freedom to study** how the software works and modify it
- **Freedom to share** copies of the software
- **Freedom to distribute** your modifications to others

With the following responsibilities:

- Any distributed modifications must be licensed under the AGPL-3.0
- Source code must be made available when distributing the software
- If you run a modified version of the software on a server and allow users to interact with it, you must make the source code available to those users
- Attribution to original authors must be maintained

## Special Note About Data and Models

While this license covers the Pandacea software and protocols, it does not automatically extend to:

1. **User Data**: Data processed through Pandacea remains under the control and existing licensing of its original owners.

2. **Model Weights**: AI models that may interact with Pandacea are not automatically covered by this license unless they directly incorporate Pandacea code.

## Commercial Use Considerations

The AGPL-3.0 allows commercial use of the software while ensuring that commercial implementations remain open source and contribute back to the community. Organizations wishing to build commercial services using Pandacea should understand:

- Your modifications to Pandacea must be shared under the same license
- You cannot incorporate Pandacea into proprietary systems without sharing those systems under AGPL-3.0
- If you offer network services using modified Pandacea code, those modifications must be made available to users

## Future Licensing Considerations

While Pandacea currently uses the AGPL-3.0 license to protect its core principles during initial development, we may consider moving to a more permissive license (such as Apache 2.0) in the future as the project matures and community norms are well-established. 

Any such change would:
- Require consent from significant contributors
- Be done transparently with community input
- Only affect versions released after the change

By contributing to Pandacea, you acknowledge this potential future direction. We will implement a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to facilitate potential license evolution while respecting all contributors.
