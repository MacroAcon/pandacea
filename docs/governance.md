# Pandacea Governance

## Overview

Pandacea practices progressive decentralization, starting with structured initial stewardship and transitioning to community control over time. Governance influence is earned through contributions to the Access Commons. Working Groups manage specific governance areas with open proposals and transparent decision-making.

## Governance Principles

1. **Progressive Decentralization**: Gradually shifting from centralized coordination to community governance
2. **Merit-Based Participation**: Influence is earned through meaningful contributions
3. **Transparent Decision Making**: All governance decisions are made in the open
4. **Working Group Autonomy**: Specialized groups maintain focused areas of the ecosystem
5. **Purpose-Aligned Incentives**: Governance rewards align with the ecosystem's core mission

## Working Groups

Pandacea governance is organized into specialized Working Groups that maintain focused areas of the ecosystem:

1. **Protocol Working Group**: Oversees the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and technical specifications
2. **Privacy & Security Working Group**: Ensures high standards for user privacy and system security
3. **Economics Working Group**: Designs and maintains fair compensation mechanisms
4. **Education & Documentation Working Group**: Creates materials to support ecosystem participants
5. **Community & Outreach Working Group**: Builds awareness and drives adoption

## Decision-Making Process

1. Proposals are submitted through standardized templates
2. Initial discussion occurs in open forums
3. Working Groups evaluate proposals relevant to their domain
4. Community feedback is gathered during review periods
5. Final decisions are made transparently with rationales provided

## Contribution Recognition

Contributions to Pandacea are recognized through:

1. **Trust Tiers**: Levels of access based on contribution history
2. **Governance Rights**: Voting power on ecosystem decisions
3. **Economic Rewards**: Compensation from the Access Commons
