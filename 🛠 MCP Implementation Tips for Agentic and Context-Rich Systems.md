# **ðŸ›  MCP Implementation Tips for Agentic and Context-Rich Systems**

Whether you're building an MCP server, client, or a full ecosystem for agent-based interaction, the following technical insights can help you avoid common pitfalls and design for long-term interoperability.

---

### **1\. Tool Discovery Happens at the Client Layer**

LLMs do not autonomously explore MCP capabilities. Clients are responsible for exposing tools and resources to the model in a structured prompt or UI. Always design your MCP client to **curate and present tools contextually**, rather than assuming the model will know how to query them.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Build an MCP-aware interface that can display available tools grouped by purpose, scope, or trust tier to both users and agents.

---

### **2\. Use Tools for Interactivity, Resources for Reference**

MCP distinguishes between **tools** (actions) and **resources** (contextual data). Tools are interactive and available to the LLM. Resources, by contrast, must be explicitly injected by the host application and are generally **not visible to or actionable by the model** unless engineered into the prompt.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Only use resources for static or pre-consented reference material. For anything that requires action or LLM selection, use a toolâ€”even if the tool just returns static data.

---

### **3\. Avoid Tool Name Collisions in Multi-Server Environments**

If using multiple MCP servers concurrently, ensure tool names are unique. Most clients do not namespace tools by server origin. This can lead to ambiguous calls or unpredictable behavior.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Prefix tool names based on the source or server role (e.g., `audit_getLog`, `wallet_getBalance`). Consider implementing a proxy server that aggregates and transforms tool lists with namespaces.

---

### **4\. Context Must Be Justified and Lightweight**

Injecting large resource lists (e.g., all available assets in a project) into context is counterproductive. Not only is this inefficient from a token usage standpoint, but most clients will struggle to represent or filter them effectively.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Represent data traversal as a series of lightweight tools (e.g., `listSceneObjects(filter)`, `getComponentSchema(name)`), not full resource dumps. This enables agent stepwise discovery aligned with user intent.

---

### **5\. Return Results as Flat, Serialized JSON Strings**

Many LLM clients and interfaces only support plain text for tool responses. Structured data should be returned as **a serialized JSON string**, not native objects or nested formats.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Keep tool output schemas flat and predictable. For complex returns, consider exposing a secondary tool for paginated or detailed queries.

---

### **6\. Implement Purpose-Aware Tool Access**

Each tool should ideally require or validate **a declared purpose** for its invocation. Embedding purpose metadata improves traceability, consent enforcement, and filtering.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Add a required `"purpose"` field to input schemas for sensitive tools, and design client logic to include purpose prompts when calling such tools.

---

### **7\. Donâ€™t Rely on Full Resource Support in All Clients**

Current clients (e.g., Claude Code, some VS Code extensions) do not support full MCP functionality, particularly dynamic or contextual resource injection.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Design your tooling to function even if resource access is unavailable. Use tools for critical features, and reserve resources for UI-facing display layers.

---

### **8\. Audit Logging and Consent Validation Should Be Tools**

LLMs often need to reason about prior actions, audit events, or permission states. These should be implemented as callable tools, not buried in client logic or side channels.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Expose tools such as `getConsentState(requestType)`, `viewAuditTrail(agentID)`, or `estimateCompensation(dataType)` to give agents and users clarity and control.

---

### **9\. Consent and Contextual Rules Should Be Queried, Not Assumed**

Do not encode user permissions statically. Implement dynamic rulesets that can be queried, refreshed, or validated at runtime.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Create tools like `checkConsentRule(purpose, dataType)` or `validateRequest(input)` to give agents a way to confirm access before acting.

---

### **10\. Build for Tool Multiplexing and Agent Negotiation**

If you expect autonomous agents to use MCP tools, design for **negotiation patterns** and **micro-call coordination** between agents. This includes ability to preview capabilities, validate input expectations, and declare constraints.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Expose tool schemas clearly and support metadata like `expectedResponseTime`, `trustLevelRequired`, or `rateLimit`.

---

### **Bonus: Proxy Layer for Tool Rewriting and Transformation**

A proxy server that dynamically rewrites, names, or scopes tools across multiple backends enables fine-grained control, abstraction, and namespacing without modifying individual servers.

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* Intercept `ListTools` calls and apply config-driven transforms to tool names, descriptions, and input/output schemas as needed. Use this to surface unified behavior across disjoint infrastructure.
